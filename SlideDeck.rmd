## Introduction

This project provides a demo for simple shiny app for preparing data product class final project. We will be using mtcars dataset.We will plot four variables using x axis, y axis, colour and size as dimensions.

## Usage

User can choose each of the four dimensions using corresponding drop down menu. 
Based on the selection plot will be rendered. 
Refer below screenshot from the app

## Plotting code

```{r}
mpgData <- mtcars
mpgData$am <- factor(mpgData$am, labels = c("Automatic", "Manual"))
```
```{r echo=TRUE}
  p <- ggplot() + geom_point(data = mpgData, aes(x= wt, y = mpg,
       color = am, size = cyl)) + scale_size(range = c(4,10)) +
       labs(caption="Mtcars data plot")
    p
```



## Source code and app
